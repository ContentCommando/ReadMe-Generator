### Features
The application is written in Node.js and launches from the command line. It features prompts that elicit essential data that should be contained in a concise README.md document. It's a time-saving application for developers.
### Languages 
 JavaScript, Node.js.
### New Tools     
The Inquirer npm was deployed in developing this application. It was a quick and easy way to integrate prompts into the application without having to create them from the start. Using the Node runtime is a time-saving and less-complicated mode of building applications as I do not need to run codes through the browser/DOM.
### Future Prospects    
To add more specific and wide-ranging prompts so that the application can be customisable to different types of projects and developers. And to also make badges and licenses displayable on GitHub
